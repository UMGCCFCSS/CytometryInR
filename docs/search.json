    "text": "Monday, October 06, 2025: “Workstation Setup”\nThe main focus of this first session is ensuring everyone’s computer is properly setup, and starts building familiarity with the infrastructure used for the rest of the course.\nParticipants install R, Rtools, Positron, Quarto, and Git; then setup and link a GitHub account. Introduces the concept of version control, and how in combination with Quarto it will be used for submitting optional take-home assignments. Finally, R packages in the flow cytometry context are discussed, including where they can be found (CRAN, Bioconductor, GitHub) and how to install them.\nMonday, October 13, 2025: “File Paths”\nThis second session covers file paths, and how they differ between operating systems (Linux, macOS and Windows). The goal is by the end of the session everyone can programmatically locate where there .fcs files are stored, list any other items present in the same folders, and assign alternate storage locations.\nMonday, October 20, 2025: “Inside an .FCS file”\nThis third session revolves around breaking open an .FCS file and seeing what are the individual components that make it up. In the process, we cover the concepts of types of data structures within R (vectors, matrices, data.frames, list).\nMonday, October 27, 2025: “Introduction to the Tidyverse”\nThis fourth session explores how the various Tidyverse packages can be used to rearrange data. We utilize the expression data we isolated from inside our experiment to manipulate data.frames and select for cells that meet certain criteria.\nMonday, November 03, 2025: “Gating Sets”\nThis fifth session involves learning about the flow cytometry infrastructure packages, namely FlowCore and flowWorkspace. We explore how they differ in function naming, memory utilization, and metadata retention. We practice adding metadata and filtering on the basis of these conditions.\nMonday, November 10, 2025: Visualizing with ggplot2\nThis sixth session provides an introduction to the ggplot2 package. We learn about various layer elements that in combination can be used to produce many types of plots. For this session, we visualize data from our fcs files with 1 and 2D histograms, as well as generate a few statistical summary plots. We provide links to additional helpful resources for those interested in learning more\nMonday, November 17, 2025: Transformations and compensation\nFor this seventh session, we explore how to transform (scale) flow cytometry data in R to more ressemble the plots we encounter using commercial software. We also explore how to apply compensation to conventional flow cytometry files.\nMonday, November 24, 2025: “It’s raining functions”\nThis eight session takes a detailed walk-through of what is a function, how arguments work, and how to create your own to do useful work and reduce the number of times code gets copied and pasted. We also cover how to use your own functions with walk and map from the purrr package.\nMonday, December 01, 2025: Downsampling and Concatenation\nThis ninth session explores how to downsample your fcs files to a desired number or percentage, and how to concatenate different samples together for use in downstream applications. We also briefly review how to create a new .fcs file.\nMonday, December 08, 2025: Spectral Signatures\nIn this tenth session we explore extracting fluorescent signatures from our samples, both beads and cells. We build on prior concepts to isolate median of the positive and negative gates. We finally wrap up showcasing various packages that have added ease of life for various steps.\nMonday, December 15, 2025: Similarities and Hotspots\nUtilizing the spectral signatures we retrieved in the prior session, we evaluate spectral similarity using cosine values and panel complexity with kappa. We finally evaluate collinearity by implementing the hotspot matrix.\nMonday, December 22, 2025: Data for Statistics\nLeveraging increasing familiarity with the various packages, we will retrieve the gates from our GatingSet and work on programmatically derriving metrics that are typically used for statistical analysis in cytometry. We will create a couple additional ggplot style plots to add to our arsenal.\nMonday, January 05, 2026:\nThis first session of the new year goes for a reach goal, how to carry out unmixing of raw .fcs files using the spectral signatures we have isolated from our unmixing controls. Once we evaluate the internals, we explore how various cytometry packages vary in their own individual approaches.\nMonday, January 12, 2026:\nIn this session, we explore openCyto and it’s automated gating templates. We explore various gating implementations and work on learning how to set the gate constraints to work for our own projects. We utilize a cell count dataset for this purpose.\nMonday, January 19, 2026:\nWe evaluate the data cleanup algorithms, PeacoQC, FlowAI, FlowCut and FlowClean, and compare the various elements that get targeted for removal. We discuss which of these are worthwhile and how to evaluate whether the algorithmic decisions make sense.\nMonday, January 26, 2026:\nWe explore unsupervised clustering approaches, primarily FlowSOM, Phenograph, and kmeans. We investigate additional ways of linking these approaches to our manual gating to evaluate the final clusters.\nMonday, February 02, 2026:\nWe investigate how to normalize cells using CytoNorm and CyCombine. We evaluate ridge plots and other approaches to carry this out further.\nMonday, February 09, 2026:\nWe perform tSNE and UMAP in R for our raw and unmixed samples. We also walk through the steps of linking to a Python installation in order to run PaCMAP and Phate visualizations.\nMonday, February 16, 2026:\nWe explore various existing implementations of annotation, that can be modified to label our various clusters and islands. We investigate how these function under the hood in their decision making.\nMonday, February 23, 2026:\nWhile we have been building familiarity with GitHub over the course, there is an art to investigating a new potential package to see if its worthwhile. This session we walk through the main points of how a Github repository is structured, and how to evaluate and use it, submit bug reports, etc.\nMonday, March 02, 2026:\nXML files all the way down\nMonday, March 09, 2026:\nIntegrating Bioconductor Workflows\nMonday, March 16, 2026:\nR packages for shits and giggles\nMonday, March 23, 2026:\nReproducibility and replicability\nMonday, March 30, 2026:\nValidating algorithmic tools\nMonday, April 06, 2026:\nQuarto Websites\nMonday, April 13, 2026:\nOpen Source Licenses\nMonday, April 20, 2026:\nDatabases and repositories\nMonday, April 27, 2026:"

    "text": "Cytometry in R: A course for beginners\n“Cytometry in R” is a free weekly mini-course being offered both online and in person at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. It is primarily geared toward those who have previous flow cytometry experience, but limited prior experience with the programming language R.\nExisting resources for learning how to work with flow cytometry files in R are limited, or have a more applied focus geared towards those who already possess intermediate bioinformatics skills. We are offering our course with the following concepts in mind: 1) That begginers benefit from having examples that they they can work through and expand on; 2) that some topics will simply take longer to fully grasp, but that consistency is key; and 3) we are all busy, and that missing a day is highly likely, and that this reality shouldn’t make or break understanding the rest of the course.\nConsequently, our mini-course will be offered in the following format:\nEach week, the course will cover a particular topic for an hour. That class is offered on multiple days and times, both in-person and online. You are invited to attend whatever day best fits your schedule for the week. If things are busy, and you can’t make your regular day, please join us for any of the other four times that week the exact same topic is being covered! In person, these are Monday, Wednesday, Friday from 4-5 pm EST in Bressler 7-035, virtual options Tuesday and Thursday 4-5 pm EST on YouTube and the Cytometry Discord.\nWhat is the cost to participate? It is free!!! What’s the catch? You learn R, and may wind up having strong opinions about flowframes vs. cytoframes.\nWhat is required? For those attending online, you will need a computer with access to the internet. The operating system shouldn’t matter, since we will be offering code examples for Linux, Mac and Windows. As with everything flow cytometry software-related, more RAM and storage space is usefull, but for most of the provided examples not required. You will need to be able to install the required software, and install R packages from the CRAN and Bioconductor repositories (as well as a few GitHub-based R packages). For those using a university IT administered computer, you may not have the permissions needed to install, and will need to reach out to them in advance. If you are using your own computer, you should have the necessary permissions.\nFor those attending in person: We have a pop-up computer lap for the conference room. If you bring your own laptop, you can directly plug in to the second screens with the provided mouse and keyboard. If you don’t have your own laptop, you can borrow one of the 6 older Linux laptops from the FlowCore for the hour. We have second-screen capacity for six people per session, with late-arrivers needing to balance their laptop on their seat.\nWhat do we provide? Each week, we will update the website with the course materials for the week. These will typically consist of the Quarto Markdown document, which is used to explain and run the R code. If you have your own data, you can bring your own data! If you don’t have some, or want to follow along, we will also make available some of our data that you can utilize.\nEach session will start with 10-15 minutes of background, where we discuss the topic, it’s connection to R and Cytometry, and what we will be doing during that session. The next 30 minutes participants work through the examples, assisted when needed by the instructors. The final 10 minutes we share insights, troubleshoot any stickpoints. We additionally will provide links to other useful resources on the topic, as well as two optional take-home problems.\nThese take-home problems are intended more for you to work with your own data in a not-so-structured manner, and start developing the problem-solving/debugging skills that take time and effort to develop. If you want instructor feedback, you can submit these back to the course through a GitHub pull request to a designated take-home folder and we will reply.\nAll course materials will be available online via our course GitHub. The teaching materials are offered under a CC-BY-SA license, while all code examples are offered under the AGPL3-0 copyleft license.\n\n \n\nThe course material is licensed under under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License.
