# Cytometry in R: A course for beginners

"Cytometry in R" is a free weekly mini-course being offered both online and in person at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. It is primarily geared toward those who have previous flow cytometry experience, but limited prior experience with the programming language R. 

Existing resources for learning how to work with flow cytometry files in R are limited, or have a more applied focus geared towards those who already possess intermediate bioinformatics skills. We are offering our course with the following concepts in mind: 1) That begginers benefit from having examples that they they can work through and expand on; 2) that some topics will simply take longer to fully grasp, but that consistency is key; and 3) we are all busy, and that missing a day is highly likely, and that this reality shouldn't make or break understanding the rest of the course.

Consequently, our mini-course will be offered in the following format: 

Each week, the course will cover a particular topic for an hour. That class is offered on multiple days and times, both in-person and online. You are invited to attend whatever day best fits your schedule for the week. If things are busy, and you can't make your regular day, please join us for any of the other four times that week the exact same topic is being covered! In person, these are Monday, Wednesday, Friday from 4-5 pm EST in Bressler 7-035, virtual options Tuesday and Thursday 4-5 pm EST on YouTube and the Cytometry Discord.

What is the cost to participate? It is free!!! What's the catch? You learn R, and may wind up having strong opinions about flowframes vs. cytoframes. 

What is required? For those attending online, you will need a computer with access to the internet. The operating system shouldn't matter, since we will be offering code examples for Linux, Mac and Windows. As with everything flow cytometry software-related, more RAM and storage space is usefull, but for most of the provided examples not required. You will need to be able to install the required software, and install R packages from the CRAN and Bioconductor repositories (as well as a few GitHub-based R packages). For those using a university IT administered computer, you may not have the permissions needed to install, and will need to reach out to them in advance. If you are using your own computer, you should have the necessary permissions. 

For those attending in person: We have a pop-up computer lap for the conference room. If you bring your own laptop, you can directly plug in to the second screens with the provided mouse and keyboard. If you don't have your own laptop, you can borrow one of the 6 older Linux laptops from the FlowCore for the hour. We have second-screen capacity for six people per session, with late-arrivers needing to balance their laptop on their seat. 

What do we provide? Each week, we will update the website with the course materials for the week. These will typically consist of the Quarto Markdown document, which is used to explain and run the R code. If you have your own data, you can bring your own data! If you don't have some, or want to follow along, we will also make available some of our data that you can utilize. 

Each session will start with 10-15 minutes of background, where we discuss the topic, it's connection to R and Cytometry, and what we will be doing during that session. The next 30 minutes participants work through the examples, assisted when needed by the instructors. The final 10 minutes we share insights, troubleshoot any stickpoints. We additionally will provide links to other useful resources on the topic, as well as two optional take-home problems. 

These take-home problems are intended more for you to work with your own data in a not-so-structured manner, and start developing the problem-solving/debugging skills that take time and effort to develop. If you want instructor feedback, you can submit these back to the course through a GitHub pull request to a designated take-home folder and we will reply. 

All course materials will be available online via our course GitHub. The teaching materials are offered under a CC-BY-SA license, while all code examples are offered under the AGPL3-0 copyleft license.
