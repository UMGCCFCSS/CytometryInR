## Day 3:


### 09:00 - 12:50 AM: Cytek Training Workshop - Good and Bad Operation

Led by **Jessica (Cytek)**

Recalls: Trainees previous exposure via the past two days of training and unmixing the small panel on Tuesday. Some overlap with David's Tuesday unmixing lecture, his focus is more introductory and contrasting to conventional flow cytometry, while this would be reinforcing on the hands on.

Covers: Unmixing good and bad operation. Reinforces the do and dont's. Proper gate setting, how to evaluate unmixing. Ideally the three rules of good reference controls.

Previews: The large experiment acquisition the trainees will be working on later that afternoon. Concepts will be recalled on Thursday for the troubleshooting lecture.

Where: The libraries computer lab, or a conference room with computer support. 


### 12:00 - 01:30 PM: Lunch - Sponsored by Cytek

-   Discussion by [***Rajan***]{style="color:red;"}

-   Covers: How today's experiment is a step-up from the previous days, this time with a **15-18 color panel**. Emphasize they will duplicate yesterday's experiment without data and then modify/adjust the settings to incorporate the additional fluorophores present in today's experiment.

-   [Meanwhile]{.underline} Trainees from each Team start up their machines and run QC


### 02:00 - 04:00 PM: Third Spectral Flow Experiment

1.  Teams led by ***Fan, David and Rajan***

2.  Structure: Each Team Lead is on a separate Cytek Aurora, with **2-3 trainees**. For this session, the [trainees take over the acquisition]{.underline}, while **moderately supervised** by the Team Lead.

3.  [Materials Required :]{.underline}

-   Lab coats.

    Pre-processed by the **Nevil Lab**

-   [2-3 fully-stained samples]{.underline} [***medium-sized panel, 15-18 colors?***]{style="color:red;"}

-   [Additional single color reference controls]{.underline} [***mix of beads and cells not acquired on Tuesday***]{style="color:red;"}

-   [Standardized worksheet]{.underline} containing specimen, experiment and panel information.

4.  [Session Workflow]{.underline}

    -   Trainees duplicate Tuesdays experiment without data. Using their experiment and panel datasheets, they identify and add additional makers to the experiment template. They figure out what reference controls are already present in either the library, and what reference controls need to be added

    -   Trainees add the reference controls, add samples, change marker names, change acquisition settings, and experiment template. [Team Lead signs off when everything is properly set up.]{.underline}

    -   Trainees navigate out and add a couple additional reference library controls (**for primary markers on non-tandem fluorophores**). Team Lead verifies they named it correctly so it can be found again.

    -   Trainees return to experiment, and select the [parameter settings used Monday/Tuesday to allow for single color reference control swapping on Thursday.]{.underline} Team Lead checks one last time and gives the go ahead to acquire.

    -   Trainees acquire all remaining single colors and samples

    -   Trainees proceed to unmix, using an external negative for the reference controls which they set under Team Lead supervision. They drop-arrow select the controls needed from the Reference Library vs from the experiment.

    -   Trainees set unmixing gates under supervision by the Team Lead. Team lead reinforces on the material covered earlier that day by the Cytek Unmixing Workshop.

        If time allows, Team Lead demonstrates how the Detector bracket position (UV7, UV8, etc) on the spectrum plot dictates what the x-axis on the plot with the positive and negative gate is set to. Showcases what happens when the bracket is incorrectly set (blank screen) as it's a frequent issue for some of the machines.

    -   Team Lead lets small unmixing gate placement issues slide to allow for issue generations, but corrects any major unmixing gate placement issues on the spot that might severely compromise the results.

    -   After unmixing, trainees generate a full NxN plot, and practice swapping between markers on the y-axis to scan for issues with the unmixing. They write down any issues to be addressed the following day.

    -   Trainees export the data to the Course folder

    -   Trainees initiate shutdown procedure for the instruments.

## Day 4:

### 09:00 - 10:20 AM: Single Color and Autofluorescence Troubleshooting

Led by ***David***

Recalls: Setting negative gates internally or externally to subtract autofluorescence. Builds on the good/bad practice Cytek workshop from Wednesday, building on where it left off.

Covers: What does a misbehaving single color reference control look like from the users perspective? Details and shows visual examples of innapropiate single color reference controls, bead/cell mismatches, insufficiently bright controls, tandem degration and mistaken fluorophore. Additionally contextualizes similar issue by autofluorescence differing between cell types and individual cells, and the impacts it can have on resolution of markers with similar emission. Shows examples of with and without general autofluorescence extract, and introduces the concept of adding an additional individual autofluorescent tags.

Previews: The troubleshooting to be done later that day on the previous day's specimens, and the intentionally screwed up specimens to be acquired that afternoon.

3.  [Materials Required:{.underline}

-   Lab coats.

   Processed by the **Nevil Lab**

-   [2-3 fully-stained samples, **intentionally complex**]{.underline} [***medium-large panel, 21-25 colors?***]{style="color:red;"}

-   No additional single color controls needed by the trainees. 

-   Team leads will need a **1-2 complete set of bead single color reference controls** available to quickly acquire in case something went wrong and needs to be replaced on the spot.

-   David will need **1-2 complete set of cell single color reference controls** to be acquired on each machines parameter settings and stored on the desktop folder ***the afternoon before*** so that they can be accessed by the trainees later that day. 

-   [Standardized worksheet]{.underline} containing specimen, experiment and panel information.

4.  [Session Workflow]{.underline}

    -   Trainees duplicate the experiment from the day before, while retaining the experimental reference controls. They will add the new specimens into the template and proceed to acquire.

    -   After acquisition, trainees will proceed to unmix. They will troubleshoot their single color gates that may retain minor gating issues from how they set the day before.

    -   Trainees will go into acquisition settings and change to their NxN unmixing template. They will proceed to identify the unmixing issues in their sample, and what channels are affected.

    -   Trainees will navigate back to unmixing and adjust gating settings using current unmixing controls. They will then check the unmixed single color reference controls to see if its a brightness issue.

    -   Trainees will then resort to either library reference controls, or by importing a single color reference control from the desktop ([**Team Lead will assist**]{.underline}) They will adjust the experiment template according to their additions to make sure correct positive negative are being referenced for their decisions.

    -   Trainees will finally explore NxN when unmixing using general autofluorescent extract, and no autofluorescence extract and note major changes. If time allows, Team Lead/David can demonstrate identification and incorporation of a new autofluorescent tag.

    -   Trainees save their data to the course folder.

    -   Trainees shut down the instruments.
